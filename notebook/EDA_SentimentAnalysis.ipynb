the film  the sets and are excellent when we get to them  and there are some startling images  but this final sequence is lacking in too many other regards    br    br   much the best drama of the piece is in the mid section  and then it plays as melodrama  arising from the  high concept  science fiction nature of it all  and insufficiently robust dialogue  there is far more human life in this part though  with the great ralph richardson sailing gloriously over the top as the small dictator  the  boss  of the everytown  i loved richardson s mannerisms and curt delivery of lines  dismissing the presence and ideas of raymond massey s aloof  confident visitor  this boss is a posturing  convincingly deluded figure  unable to realise the small fry nature of his kingdom    it s not a great role  yet richardson makes a lot of it  br    br   everytown itself is presumably meant to be england  or at least an english town fairly representative of england  interesting was the complete avoidance of any religious side to things  the  things to come  seem to revolve around a conflict between warlike barbarism and a a faith in science that seems to have little ultimate goal  but to just go on and on  there is a belated attempt to raise some arguments and tensions in the last section  concerning more personal  life   yet one is left quite unsatisfied  the film hasn t got much interest in subtle complexities  it goes for barnstorming spectacle and unsubtle  blunt moralism  every time  and  of course  recall the hedged bet finale  raymond massey waxing lyrical about how uncertain things are   br    br   concerning the question of the film being a prediction  i must say it s not at all bad as such  considering that one obviously allows that it is impossible to gets the details of life anything like right  the grander conceptions have something to them  a war in       well that was perhaps predictable    lasting nearly    years  mind   a nuclear bomb   the  super gun  or some such contraption   in         a technocratic socialist  we don t believe in independent nation states  type government  in britain  after         hmmm  sadly nowhere near on that one  chaps      no real politics are gone into here which is a shame  all that surfaces is a very laudable anti war sentiment  generally  it is assumed that dictatorship   whether boneheaded luddite fascist  as under the boss  or all hands to the pump scientific socialism   will  be the deal   and these implications are not broached    while we must remember that in       there was no knowledge at all of how nazism and communism would turn out   or even how they were turning out   the lack of consideration of this seems meek beside the scope of the filmmakers  vision on other matters  br    br   much of the earlier stuff should   and could   have been cut in my opinion  only the briefest stuff from        would have been necessary  yet this segment tends to get rather ponderous  and it is ages before we get to the richardson massey parts  i would have liked to have seen more done with margareta scott  who is just a trifle sceptical  cutting a flashing eyed mediterranean figure to negligible purpose  the character is not explored  or frankly explained or exploited  except for one scene which i shall not spoil  and her relationship with the boss isn t explored  but then this was the     s  and there was such a thing as widespread institutional censorship back then  edward chapman is mildly amusing in his two roles  more so in the first as a hapless chap  praying for war  only to be bluntly put down by another massey character  massey himself helps things a lot  playing his parts with a mixture of restraint and sombre gusto  contrasting well with a largely diffident cast  save for richardson  and scott and chapman  slightly  br    br   i would say that  things to come  is undoubtedly a very extraordinary film to have been made in britain in       one of the few serious british science fiction films to date  indeed  its set  piece  design and harnessing of resources are ravenous  marvellous   br    br   yet  the script is ultimately over earnest and  at times  all over the place  the direction is prone to a flatness  though it does step up a scenic gear or two upon occasion  the cinematographer and mr richardson really do salvage things however  respectively

money but should they  war of the worlds and minority report had the budget to pay for a decent script  tom cruise et al  and ss himself but were still awful  i m sure avp wasted     of their budget

ridley scott  james cameron  and others were idiots for developing characters you actually want to see either live or get killed  in this installment you will never care who lives or dies  not a kid  a parent  a pregnant woman  the characters serve only one purpose in this movie  to die  the opening scenes establish the fact that the movie is going to be a predictable joke  the character development scenes mix clich s  bad humor  and bad acting and numb the viewer to the point where we really don t care if they get killed so long as they die in never before seen ways  but they don t

stealing the rest from other recent sci fi films  br    br   there is not one original use of the either the alien or pred characters  the pred actually has little trouble killing aliens by the dozen even though the last movie led us to believe that pred revered the aliens as such a deadly foe that they used the killing of one as rite of passage  the alienpred is never really developed as a fearsome creature  its ability to inject parasites into a host is ripped from several different movies most recently probably was hellboy where samiel s dismembered tongue injected eggs into hellboy or doom where the mutated creatures would leave their tongues behind after they speared a victim s throat  br    br   simply put we aren t given reason to care about anything in this movie  there is violence but it doesn t shock or surprise and is nothing that hasn t been seen in any of a hundred slasher flicks  the cg is ok and both species of alien are made to look and move as they have in movies past  but since the characters are never developed and the acting is so bad we kind of hope that they all die  the little girl was probably the best actor of the bunch but sadly we aren t made to care whether or not kids  women  or anyone else lives or dies  we just want the movie to end  eventually it does but not before another stolen plot line from resident evil   has a nuke aim gunnison

it  schtick  this is the duo as a grotesque parody of themselves  in between  their relationship is now solely constructed of uncertain acting  asinine dialogue and half hearted slapstick  people slate king of new york  but chaplin s final bow out was nowhere near as undignified as this  br    br   what really hurts to someone who loves laurel and hardy is the appearance of the two comedians  the video cover i m holding shows them at their prime  all boyish smiles and glowing skin  with a blurb on the back that reads  the photograph on this sleeve is for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the content of the film   necessarily  it doesn t even come close  the actual film sees them at least fifteen years older than the photographs that adorn the sleeve  with ollie distressingly overweight  this is not humorously  or comically  fat  as he would normally appear  but ill looking and on the verge of obesity  he would be dead seven years after this film was made  after a series of strokes  stan  meanwhile  suffering a prostrate problem and dysentery  looks ghoulish as his weight has plummeted drastically  every time something bad happens to him  such as getting squashed between a lifeboat and a table  you fear for his life  even ollie giving him a traditional slap makes you terrified he could be killed  he would last for another fifteen years after the completion of this film  eventually passing away from a heart attack in       it s upsetting to think of such cherished performers growing old and dying painful deaths  and it s distressing watching their deterioration  both in health  and in performance  on screen  when i  and  i m sure  almost everyone else  likes to think of laurel and hardy  i think of way out west  busy bodies or our relations  seeing them in such physical ill health and performing dire routines at the dog end of their career is a blight on my happy memories of them  br    br   the warning signs are clear right from the opening credits  which list not only four writers  but also someone to come up with the concept  and a credit for  gags   so if monty collins was writing the  gags   then what were the other four writing  and in that case  why was monty collins paid a fee  given that there s no evidence of a single  gag  in the whole film  over     of the movie is spent travelling to the eponymous island  during which we experience some of the most painfully unfunny scenes the boys were ever involved in  when i saw the bat scene i wanted to curl up and die  so great was its childish ineptitude  yet what kills the film stone dead is that all of the support cast are dubbed  unable to speak english  not only does this make the film disjointed  but also it severely depletes stan and ollie s reactions to their co stars  flatly directed with appalling film stock and absolutely atrocious editing  this totally belies the rumoured    million that was spent on it  frankly  it looks terrible  and while a dvd release might clean up the picture  the sound and image quality is vastly inferior to any of their hal roach work  br    br   stan and ollie s  friends   giovani and antoine are charisma free bores who stand out greatly against laurel and hardy s outdated repertoire  this is another major problem with the film  in that none of the supporting characters are funny  or keyed in to the boys  innocent mentality  the dubbed harshness shown to l   h   you   the fat one   makes them stand out as isolated social misfits  rather than loveable sub anarchists  there is evidence of some darker political satire   though duck soup this ain t   and the concept of an island with no rules is an interesting topic  perhaps more relevant now than it ever was  a film that looks at the problems of immigration and the american constitution suddenly becomes most topical in       sadly  however  beyond an amusing scene where stan is elected  the people   this doesn t really go anywhere  and this somewhat black humour does have its harsh edges   or is a laurel and hardy movie where rape is directly implied and stan threatens a man with a bottle  only to accidentally glass someone in the face  your idea of a good time  after all the years of stan and ollie sharing a bed  we also get a definite reference  with stan accidentally kissing him   ollie wipes off the kiss in disgust  also worrying is the implication that stan and ollie s illegal immigrant friend  antoine  ends his life being eaten by a lion  mind you  i never thought i d see a laurel and hardy movie where they were due to be hanged  either  the need for the intrusive and unfunny narration is a further pointer to how messy the whole thing is  with the american release  the same version available on video  hacking out    minutes in a vain attempt to improve it  br    br   almost completely unwatchable  this horrifically made  relentlessly unfunny movie serves only to tarnish the reputation of stan and

       " 'the vindicator opens with the memorable scene of a monkey in a cage attacking a ripping apart a small toy robot as part of a scientific experiment  this random act violence sold it for me and i m happy to say the rest of vindicator provided a veritable feast of cheese  br    br   the vindicator is about a scientist  david mcilwraith  who is nearly killed an explosion in his lab whose tattered remains are put inside an experimental body suit armour  for some unfathomable reason he is fitted with a rage response activator  a device wired into his brain that will turn him homicidal if he comes into physical contact with any other person  they give some daft explanation about how it is a necessary defensive mechanism but i cannot see the logic in installing such a device unless you wanted a rampaging cyborg killing machine  it is especially ridiculous when it is indicated the suit carl is wearing is actually an experimental space suit  what possible need would there be for an astronaut to turn into the incredible hulk whilst on a mission  he predictably breaks out of the lab and proceeds to battle the dodgy scientists who put him in the suit  along with the ninja assassin hunter played by pam grier  no  really   br    br   the vindicator itself looks pretty damn goofy  it is basically a dude in a mangled golden foil suit  he also has a perpetually bewildered look in his eyes  that doesn t inspire fear or even compassion  i guess you can t blame him for that  most people watching the movie will have that same look on their faces  br    br   the acting is of the really bad  stilted   i m not sure what the character s emotions or thoughts are that this point so i ll take a punt and spurt out my dialogue in a random tone of voice whilst trying not look at the camera  school of acting  the actor playing the funky black scientist even struggles with this last part  br    br   it is after this initial accidental death that the vindicator goes after the scientists  strangely enough the whole rage response activator  touch me and i ll kill you  thing doesn t play as big a role as you might expect with carl going after his former colleges in a reasonably detached manner  there was one scene where he rather brutally kills some street punks who push him around  i know that it is de rigueur for street gangs to randomly assault the lead characters in eighties movies but surely one of them must have realised it might be a bad idea to attack the hulking cyborg guy even if he does look like c po s retarded cousin  as it is they don t even seem that surprised to see a mangled golden cyborg walking down the street as though it was an every day occurrence for them  the only other time this rage response activator comes up in the movie is when old carl can t give his wife a hug  when hunter tries to turn this against him by throwing her into him so he ll be forced to kill her he casually remarks he has reprogrammed himself  off screen naturally  so this doesn t happen  they could have left out the whole rage response activator thing and just gone with a straight revenge story and it wouldn t have made a huge difference to the movie  br    br   there is an amusing sequence in the sewers as grier and her cronies track down the vindicator  due to his armoured hide they are all armed with weapons which fire  vapourised acid   for some bizarre reason when these weapons fire it is represented on screen by cartoonish red lines that streak toward their targets ala ghostbusters  the vindicator fights back by ripping a gas pipe out of the wall and incinerating all of grier s goons in an enormous streak of flame that comes out  the resulting fireball is so huge and powerful that it comes out of the sewers out of a man hole and blows up the van a couple of the scientists are  strangely enough grier escapes by throwing herself down into the inch deep water despite the fact she was closest to the vindicator  this is one of several fake fiery explosions throughout the movie  including the death of funky black scientist when the vindicator sends his van of a cliff   this is after they capture the vindicator by trapping him in a giant lump of gello  no  seriously    br    br   there is also one unsettling and long and out of place sequence in which carl s treacherous overweight friend  who looks like a poor man s ned beatty  reveals his infatuation with carl s wife and tries to rape her  it goes on for about      minutes and is full of disturbing shots of the guy slobbering over the wife s face  gyrating on top of her and trying to pull her dress off  it is icky to say the least and seems really out of whack with most of the rest of the movie which is kind of cartoonish and larger than life in its violence  br    br   the movies finale involves the vindicator battling a whole bunch of other dudes in battle suits  for whatever reason all these other dudes are less kick arse than carl  some of them being dispatched by the wife simply by having a protruding tube in their side ripped out  luckily for carl the suit he is wearing lacks this crucial design flaw  the only really memorable part toward the end is the death of grier  doing something i ve never seen a baddie do in a movie before  in the middle of her confrontation with the vindicator she decides she really doesn t stand a chance against him and in a rather of matter of fact manner blows her own brains out with his pistol ',\n",

       " 'i watched  deadly voyage  because david suchet was in it  after enjoying him in the  poirot  series  and joss ackland is always worth watching  so i went into the film with an expectation of it being a potentially worthwhile film  alas  it was not to be  br    br   i won t bother critiquing the performances  the pacing  the cinematography or any other structural aspect of the film  others here have already given their opinions on those elements  the only thing i want to address is the film s message  since it proclaims in the intro that it s based upon a true story  and therein hangs the film s supposed importance  br    br    deadly voyage  primarily focuses upon an impoverished black african man named kingsley who wants to move to the us  because he believes that he can make money there  nothing more  nothing less    his motivation is utterly selfish   of course some people will prevaricate by saying that he was doing it for his family  but in fact he decided to have children on the income he could make in ghana  so he really just created his own problem   to that end  kingsley decides to stow away aboard a russian freighter bound for new york  in the process of doing this  he faces harsh conditions  racist crew members and other challenges  br    br   but this is precisely where the film leaves me unsympathetic  why should the audience be expected to care about kingsley  simply because he has a goal  goals aren t such a rare commodity that his should be privileged above say  the goal of the ship s captain or the woman he left at home with his newborn child  kingsley s goal is illegal in the eyes of the us government  it is also illegal in that it steals from the russian shipping company  if he makes it to the us  it would involve taking out of a system that he has not put into  and if he gets caught  the shipping company will be fined          i doubt very much that any of the stowaways care about what their chosen course of action is costing anyone else  they re clearly just out for their own gain  he could ve spent the        he won in the lottery at the beginning of the film  for legal passage to the us  and applied for residency and a work permit  instead  he takes the illegal  and dangerous  route  br    br   so since kingsley s voyage is illegal  selfish and cannot be ethically justified  why should we care about him or his ordeal  simply because he faces challenges  why should his challenges be privileged above the challenge of the russian shipping company getting to new york without stowaways  because he s black and the shipping company is white  the reason seems to be because danny glover  the film s executive producer  and others involved want us to root for kingsley  as if he s a hero on some sort of noble voyage  but once you accept that illegal immigration  theft and a fool s mission aren t noble at all  you can t really care about him  br    br   before anyone plays the race card  i assure you that i would ve felt the same no matter what ethnicity nationality the involved parties were  imagine if a british person decided to stow away in a train headed for bhutan  sneak across the border  and collect  unwanted  buddhist antiquities  to bring back to britain to sell  how much sympathy could the challenges he faced generate  very little  i d bet  so why should we feel different for kingley  because he s black  because he s poor by american standards  the filmmakers are banking on us sharing their views that the ends justify the means  and that a shipping company being fined         is inconsequential compared to the remote possibility of an unskilled laborer earning slightly more in the us than he could ve if he had just stayed in his own home country  i didn t buy it for a minute ',\n",

       " 'which do you think the average person would know more less about  iranian cinema or iranian football  interestingly  the two come to the forefront of controversial iranian filmmaker jafar panahi s latest film entitled  offside   a tale that uses football or access to football as a backdrop for a series of scenes revolving around one s right to do something or go somewhere and an individual s right to extend that courtesy if and when they d like to  the odd thing is  you don t come away from offside having learnt about iranian football or too much about iranian cinema  unless it s an education in panahi s controversial style   but you do come away feeling enlightened  that at least someone from iran has taken a controversial issue that is clearly still very much in force in a nation like iran  and is willing to present it to an international audience rather than exploit it  br    br   i can remember the      world cup  i m sure many people can  it was the summer after my initial year out at university and after the slog that was my first year  a summer of world cup football acted as a nicely timed tonic  needless to say  i saw practically every game bar the ones they show simultaneously with the other ones at the very end of the group stages so that to avoid incidences as seen in spain     when it was thought west germany and austria transpired to get a result between them that would see them both through at the expense of algeria  br    br   anyone in britain that was watching the bbc s broadcast of the iran   mexico game  both nations  first of the tournament  may remember that at the top of the show  the bbc s football anchorman gary lineker let off a snide comment to introduce the match  it went something like   we ve seen giants germany  england  argentina and holland play but now we get to see         mexico and iran battle it out   the emphasis on the latter two being inferior was clear and that maybe watching them was a chore  it s a shame because there are people  and films like offside present them  who are really willing to see iran play to the point where they risk their well being to achieve it and it s sad when people in a position of power dismiss what they deem  inferior  when there are others who d do anything to have the chance to otherwise engage  br    br   when immediately thinking of the words  iran    football  and  world cup   my mind flies back to the france     game between said nation and america  here is a film about a world cup game of sorts involving iran but where some or indeed most iranian filmmakers may well have opted to present a tale revolving around iran s famous victory over the united states and what that meant to them  director panahi chooses to look at what goes on behind the scenes and presents a story from the stands as women are barred from football matches and are not allowed to live the ecstasy of winning a game of immense magnitude  you can imagine a heavy handed film detailing iran s  victory  as a lumbering propaganda film designed to exploit as they  defeat  a western power or  enemy  at a sport they perhaps were not expected to do so in  br    br   a couple of films that spring to mind when it comes to beating the unbeatable at their own game are      indian film  lagaan   in which the indian peasants defeat the ruling british at cricket  similalry       s  the game of their lives  sees the americans defeat the english at a football match only this time in the      world cup  the differences between these films and offside are immense  offside is looking at a situation behind a state s mentality and dares to explore an essence of feminism as the girls  trying to see their beloved iran defeat bahrain and qualify for the world cup  are rounded up like animals and kept in a crude purgatory mere feet from a barred window that would allow them to see the game  the reasoning is to do with the foul language the men  may   not will  but  may  use during the game  the film presents iran as so incompetent that they cannot take away a man s right to swear and ban the bad language but must ban a woman s right to see the game all together   it is no wonder panahi s film was itself banned in iran  br    br   but panahi remembers to include what makes the rule so crazy in the first place by frequently allowing his female characters to both smoke cigarettes and use mobile phones  two things the doctors and scientists will have you think are far more dangerous to the human body mind than hearing a little bit of foul language at a football match  panahi pays special attention to the title of his film  offside  which itself is a ruling within football detailing when an  attacker  is  caught  trying to gain an advantage in the field of play  the parallels run with the womens  position in the film as these advancing  supposedly without right  individuals are caught trying to put one over the opposition team  that being the state itself  br    br   i think offside is one of the better films to come out of the middle east and surrounding gulf area that i ve seen  it s a tense but humbling film about people who do not carry any acting history according to the imdb and thus  the acting is raw and real adding that quaint neo realist aura to it all  the immediate ending is haunting and the constant verbal battle between the male soldiers and female wrong doers who dared to defy the state is wonderful  i also think for anyone to actually dislike the film for the reasons i ve mentioned shows a distinct level of callous  either that or you work in the iranian government ',\n",

       " '     s  frightmare  is an odd little film  the director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classic    s    s style horror movies with the shock factor of the then exploding    s slasher genre  it isn t totally successful  mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraints  and the less than professional caliber of its cast of young actors  but it still has its moments  mostly due to the classy performance  classier than the movie deserves  by the late german actor ferdinand mayne  who plays an aging old time horror movie star  ala vincent price  named  conrad ratzoff   at the beginning of the movie we meet the has been horror star as he s shooting a commercial for dentures and we quickly learn that ol  conrad is a bit of a hoity toity  prima donna jerk off  just when you think he couldn t be any more un likable  the commercial director berates conrad for blowing a take for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him off a balcony to his death  nice  huh  conrad then visits some fans at a college campus horror movie club  unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die  still feisty even at death s door  he manages to do away with a despised business associate by smothering him with a pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself  conrad is then laid to rest in true hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screens above the casket  which will play personal video messages from conrad himself for visitors who enter to pay their respects  br    br   it is at this point that the kids from the college horror movie society decide to pay conrad s grave an after hours visit  breaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party   not exactly my idea of fun  but hey  these are characters in an    s horror film  logic has no place here   the college kids spend the evening having dinner with conrad s body seated in a place of honor  posing for photos with it and even dancing around the room with it  before parking conrad and his coffin in the attic  planning to return him to his crypt in the morning  in the meantime  mrs  ratzoff  distraught over the theft of her husband s body  has called in a psychic friend to try and  reach  conrad through a seance  you can pretty much figure out the rest from here  since conrad wasn t a very nice guy in life  it s not much of a stretch to assume that he won t be any friendlier in death  psychic lady makes contact with conrad and he re awakens in predictably ticked off fashion  then spends the rest of the movie strolling around the corridors of the students  ridiculously huge house  picking off the young grave robbers one by one  this is where the movie falls apart  endless scenes of teens wandering around empty hallways saying  hello  is anyone there   are intercut with occasional bursts of violence  we do get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene  which is the highlight of the movie  before the last two survivors finally figure out  way later than any semi intelligent people would have figured out the same thing   but again  we re in an    s horror film   that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get conrad s body back to its crypt where it belongs  the sluggish pacing is padded out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by a soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effects rather than music thunder  moans and groans  howls  etc   that becomes severely annoying after a while  br    br   i can t really recommend  frightmare  to anyone who didn t grow up watching cheap movies like this on late night cable back in the    s   modern horror  fans will doubtlessly find  frightmare  incredibly slow moving and goofy  if you came of age in that magical decade  however  you may get a blast of nostalgia from  frightmare   fans of jeffrey   re animator   combs may also want to check it out  as the future dr  west appears in an early role here as one of the unlucky film students  br    br   i will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the eastwestdvd label  paired with roy ward s  vault of horror  and sold at dollar stores  because the print quality is terrible  i m told the film has gotten a deluxe release via the fine folks at troma  which seems appropriate  if you re a troma kind of person then  frightmare  will be right up your alley ',\n",

hugging grandmother who makes dolls out of socks  and her brother andrew  who s into electronics and is grumpy  grams accidentally hangs up on the lieutenant governor  which indicates she s getting in the way while living with the family  the two children eat breakfast while the adults discuss moving grams to a retirement home  bridget makes an awful looking pancake sandwich containing cereal  eggs  bacon  strawberries  and syrup  as andrew looks on incredulously  the two kids then discuss grams  and andrew says bluntly that grams is being  put out to pasture   bridget talks with grams in the

move away  huggins says bridget could talk to the bookworm in huggaland about it  since he knows everything  they step through the mirror to visit huggaland  but one of bridget s tennis shoes becomes lodged in the mirror  br    br   rather than walk around with one shoe  bridget goes without shoes in huggaland  they immediately meet hugsy  a curly haired living boy doll in huggaland  huggins gives hugsy the baseball cap  they also meet tickles  bubbles  impkins  and tweaker  and all the dolls sing a song while sitting on a bridge  hugsy takes bridget and huggins in his hugwagon to see the bookworm  who lives atop a stack of giant books  the bookworm consults  the old encyclopedia  and finds that old age can be cured by eating the fruit of the  youngberry tree   however  only one such tree exists  and it s in the country of shrugs  ruled by the mad queen of quartz  the only way to travel to shrugs is to jump down a deep hole that is located inside a nearby giant book  br    br   bridget and the two dolls gulp three times  jump down the hole  and tumble out  soon they walk down a sideways sidewalk  hear the sea of glass breaking  and fall off the sidewalk when the sideways gravity ends  they encounter  the hairy behemoth   which looks like a mastodon  has four tusks  and breathes fire out its trunk  but hugsy boldly goes over and hugs the behemoth  who thereby turns into a baby elephant whose name is hodgepodge  hodgepodge had been under a spell by the queen  and owes hugsy a favor  so they all ride on hodgepodge s back to the castle  they enter the castle  are surrounded by troll like beings  the queen  queen admira  comes  and bridget asks for a few youngberries  the queen refuses  then eats one for herself  and brags about her own youthful good looks while looking in a hand mirror  hodgepodge faints when the queen says he should be  digested   the queen is upset when bridget mentions that wicked witches should have warts  so the queen freezes bridget and orders the three others to be taken to the dungeon  but the queen carelessly leaves the key to the youngberry tree s dome by the lock to the dome lifting apparatus  br    br   hodgepodge wakes up in the dungeon and uses his  noodle   trunk  to pull the jail s door down  thereby freeing himself and the two dolls with him  they find bridget standing petrified  the dolls hug her  which causes bridget to be revived  before they flee  bridget finds the left behind key to the youngberry tree dome  lifts the dome off  and they pick some glowing youngberries and put them in a jar  the queen catches them  but the queen s arm is trapped under the descending dome while reaching for the key that bridget left on the ground  the queen suddenly turns very old since she is deprived of the youth giving berries  and appears to die  soon bridget steps back through the mirror into her bedroom but trips on the bottom of the mirror  spilling the berries onto her floor  and the berries quickly vanish into smoke  one by one  her mother calls for her and andrew to say goodbye to grams  who is leaving for a retirement home  andrew drops his usual grumpy  standoffish facade and hugs

been the main person pressuring grams to move out  br    br   andrew asks bridget for his st  louis cardinals cap  bridget starts to explain how she gave it to huggins of huggaland  but andrew doesn t want to listen to what he believes are her fantasy stories  so he turns around to look for it in her bedroom  one of the dolls secretly hands the cap back through the mirror to bridget  bridget puts

act arrangement of western drama  in  men and maggots   eisenstein dramatizes the pre revolutionary oppression and discontent of the battleship s working class sailors as the situation inevitably builds to mutiny  even before the sailors and their upper class officers masters are visually introduced  eisenstein establishes revolutionary conditions symbolically by the collision editing of waves breaking violently and ominously at sea  onboard ship we witness crowded  unsanitary conditions  eisenstein emphasizes the sailors  dehumanization with shots of arbitrary lashings  harsh labor  and   most memorably   the maggot infested meat intended for the evening s meal  the ship s nearsighted physician is brought forward by the other officers to declare the meat perfectly suitable to be served with the dark soup  boiling like the sailors  rage  in accordance with marxist maxims  the church also fails the men  and we see one of them smashing a plate inscribed with words from the lord s prayer from two different camera angles  in perhaps the first deliberate  jump cut  in cinema history   br    br   identified by inter titles as  drama on the quarterdeck  and  an appeal from the dead   potemkin s second and third parts depict the actual mutiny and the onshore funeral of its leader and first hero of the revolution  vakulinchuk  united by vakulinchuk s appeals to brotherhood  the initial mutineers are joined by the entire crew in an attack on the officers  a chaotic scene ensues whose violent passion is served well by eisenstein s editing techniques  the officers  quarters are trampled and symbols of their privilege are destroyed  the ship s doctor is thrown overboard  accompanied by dramatic crosscuts to the maggot ridden meat and his eyeglasses metonymically dangling in the rigging  tragically  vakolinchuk s death is the price paid for the revolt  no omelet without breaking eggs  and he is laid out with dignity on an odessa pier  hundreds of ordinary odessa citizens gather with the sailors to honor him and to pledge  death to the oppressors   shots of fists clenching and unclenching signal the birth of revolutionary consciousness  br    br   the complex and unforgettable odessa steps sequence constitutes the film s fourth act  it begins with uplifting music and a series of close ups and medium shots on the elated faces of diverse people on the shore and selected objects  parasol  eyeglasses  baby carriage   suddenly  as exclaims a title card in huge letters  the music stops and lines of soldiers with drawn rifles and fixed bayonets appear at the top of the steps  here eisenstein releases the full force of collision editing as nearly a hundred shots are pieced together to contrast the panicked mayhem and victimization of the citizenry with the relentless assault of the soldiers driving the citizens down to the trampling horses and flying sabers of the waiting cossacks below  the mise en scene is framed by a statue of caesar at the top of the stairs and a church at the bottom  symbolic metonyms for russia s oppressive institutions  tsarist monarchy and the orthodox christian church  br    br   punctuating the sequence are two scenes involving mothers and children  in the first  a mother and young boy who had been introduced among the joyous faces in the crowd are among the slaughter s first victims  the boy is shot  but the mother continues running until close ups of her face convey her horrified gaze at the son s fallen body being trampled by the crowd  with a much slowed editing pace  the camera follows the mother as she carries the lifeless body of her child up the stairs to confront the soldiers  shown only in a diagonal shadow line   they summarily shoot her dead  after this lull  the carnage continues for another several dozen cuts until a second mother is shot through the stomach  the womb of mother russia   as she tries to shield her baby in its carriage  in a scene famously imitated in the untouchables  the carriage incongruously slips down the staircase  horrified faces of huddled citizens watch the slow progress to its doom  when the carriage reaches the bottom there is a cut to a cossack wielding a sword and a classic kuleshov effect suggests what we do not actually see  the slaughtering of this pure and symbolic innocent  the final series of shots in the odessa sequence is of three stone lions  one in repose  one sitting up  and one roaring  the editing animates them into a visual metaphor of the people s awakened rage  br    br   somewhat anticlimactically  the fifth act returns us to the battleship as the mutinous sailors flee on the high seas and await an encounter with other ships from the fleet  they and the viewer expect retribution  but when the meeting occurs no shots are fired and instead all the sailors wave and throw their hats in the air in a symbol of comradeship  eisenstein was rewriting history at this point since the revolution was not successfully launched for another twelve years  but that quibble aside  battleship potemkin stands as one of the seminal works of the silent film era  and it retains extraordinary cinematic power ',\n",

       " 'i had never heard of leos carax until his merde segment in last years tokyo  and his was easily the stand out the film s three stories  it wasn t my favorite of the shorts  but it was the most unique  and the most iconic   the lovers on the bridge  was the first of his full length features i ve seen  a virtuoso romantic film that uses image and music to communicate an exuberant young love that overflows into the poetic  though he s classified as a neo nouvelle vogue  his films owe as much to silent cinema as the    s experimental narratives  his movies are closer to jean vigo in  l atlante   jean cocteau  and guy maddin  than godard and truffaut  br    br   in boy meets girl carax s      debut he uses black and white and the heavy reliance on visual representation to display emotional states  he combines the exaggerated worlds of maddin  but based in a reality that never seems quite stable like cocteau  but by virtue of its expressions it becomes more accessible  emotional  and engaging like vigo s movies  br    br   the story of boy meets girl is simple  and similar to carax s two following films which comprise this  young lovers  trilogy  a boy named alex played by denis lavant  who plays a character named alex in carax s next two movies   has just been dumped by his girlfriend who has fallen in love with his best friend  in the first scene he nearly kills his friend on a boardwalk but stops short of murder  he walks around reminded of her by sounds of his neighbors having sex  and daydreams of his girlfriend and best friend getting intimate  he steals records for her and leaves them at his friend s apartment  but avoids contacting either of them directly  he wanders around and finds his way to a party  where he meets a suicidal young woman  and the film becomes part  breathless  and part  limelight   br    br   later he is advised by an old man with sign language to  speak up for yourself   young people today it s like they forgot how to talk   the old man gives an anecdote about working in the days of silent film  and how an actor timid off stage became a confident  lion  when in front of the camera  heres where the movie tips its hand  but the overt reference to silent film is a crucial scene  since it overlaps the style of the film  silent and expressionist   with the content  a lovelorn young man trying to work up the courage to say and do the things he really wants to   though alex is pensive at first and a torrent of romantic words tumbling out of him by the end  he is the shy actor who becomes a lion thanks to the films magnification of his inward feelings which aren t easy to nail down from moment to moment  aside from a desire to fall in love  br    br   there is a scene in the film where alex retreats from the party into a room where the guests have stashed their children and babies  all crying in a chorus that fills that room  until he turns on a tape of a children s show making them fall silent  unexpectedly due a glitch the tv ends up playing a secret bathroom camera which reveals the hostess sobbing to herself into her wig about someone she misses  even as carax is self reflexive and self deprecating of the very kind of angst ridden coming of age tale he is trying to tell  the room full of whining infants   he s mature enough to see through the initial irony to the lovelorn in everything the film crosses  even the rich old  bell of the ball has a brother she misses  in another scene an ex astronaut stares at the moon he once walked on in his youth while sipping a cocktail in silence  br    br   though indebted to films before talkies  carax is a master of music  knowing when to pipe in the dead kennedy s  holiday in cambodia   or an early david bowie song  the sounds of a man playing piano  or of a girl softly humming  br    br   in boy meets girl  when someone gets their heart broken we see blood pour from their shirt  when a couple kiss on the sidewalk they spin     degrees as if attached to a carousel  when alex enters a party an feels out of place  its because the most interesting people in the world really are in attendance  like the famous author who can t speak because of a bullet lodged in his brain  or the miss universe of      standing just across from the astronaut  this film is the missing link between jean piere jenuet  michel gondry  and wes anderson  whose stylistic flourishes and quirky tales of whimsy  all have a parallel with different visuals  musical  and emotional cues in these carax movies  br    br   every line of dialog  every piece of music and every effect and edit in this movie resonated with me on some emotional level  some i lack words to articulate  there are many tales of a boy meeting a girl  but rather than just explore the banal details of any particular event this movie captures the ecstatic truth of adolescent passion and disappointment  the other movies you want to watch can wait  see this first  if i were to make films  i would want them to be like this  in fact i wish all films were like this  where the ephemeral becomes larger than life  and life itself becomes a dream ',\n",

one  this rather rambling guerrilla warfare escapade through the colourful mountains of bolivia is probably destined to disappoint more people than it will satisfy  so why was the film  and particularly benicio del toro s performance  so loudly praised at cannes  br    br   james rocchi  for instance  called it  a work of art that s   not just the story of a revolutionary   but   a revolution in and of itself   the guardian s peter bradshaw called it a  flawed masterpiece   i return to my original contention for part one   that the value lies particularly in depiction of a hero figure  and in an age when there is a surfeit of poor hero role models  could it not be salutary to see a strongly honourable one  even if stripped of some of the less endearing episodes of his life  this is the psychological hero enshrined by the great scottish essayist  thomas carlyle  in his seminal book  heroes and hero worship  heroes can be real or imaginary  or somewhere in between   but should genuinely inspire us to higher goals  a higher purpose  compare this with the unrealistic  heroes  of standard western storytelling  where a person undergoes trials and tribulations before obtaining a barely believable reward   usually everlasting love or material wealth   as if by divine studio intervention  real heroes have an excess of moral courage   not lost ark dare devilishness or james bond super toys  they rise  and empower others to rise  to be the best that they can be  in part one  che succeeds  in part two  he fails  it is not for want of moral courage but since a  not all good plans can succeed and b  being human  mistakes are inevitable  br    br   guevara s intellectual clarity is flawed when he equates conditions that justify armed struggle with conditions that make that armed struggle able to succeed  it is a serious miscalculation  br    br   high in the mountains from la paz  the colours are breathtaking  there is an air of mise en scene authenticity that was occasionally lacking in che   part one  the u s  would not allow soderbergh to film in cuba   visual treats are heightened by maximising natural light and the extreme flexibility and realism offered with groundbreaking red cameras  this is a high performance digital cine camera with the quality of   mm film and the convenience of pure digital  designed for flexibility and functionality  the package weighs a mere   lbs   shooting with red is like hearing the beatles for the first time   says soderbergh   red sees the way i see       so organic  so beautifully attuned to that most natural of phenomena   light   if che had stopped with the successful cuban revolution it would have enshrouded him with an almost mystical invincibility  that he fails in bolivia shows not only that he has human limitations but that it is his moral virtues that are remembered  not the political triumph  critics will say   and with some justification   that his armed struggle inspired much less noble characters to achieve tin pot dictatorships  his development of guerrilla fighting tactics are not good or bad in themselves  and have since been used for both   br    br   but for all its praiseworthiness  the film often seems to lack dramatic and narrative tension  we stumble from one escapade to another  knowing that he will eventually meet his death  i found myself glancing at my watch and thinking it could have been shorter  but the work that has gone into this   interviews with people from all sides and even getting one of guevara s ex comrades to coach actors on the minutiae of the bolivian operations   make the film a commendable achievement  it might not be top flight entertainment  but it demonstrates integrity in documenting a significant slice of history  br    br   there is also another very important point in the che  hero  figure here  it s about failure  that if you try your utmost  even if you fail  your effort will not have been in vain because it may give others hope and moral courage  one could cynically call it a  martyr  complex  and it is found  of course  in many religious figures as well  but che does not  sacrifice  himself  he does what he does best  to the best of his not inconsiderate ability  and so provides an example  success or failure in any particular instance become mere details  br    br   with the u s  s longstanding and illegal blockade of cuba  all in the name of  freedom    i am tempted to write that che parts       are too good to be wasted on the u s  but that would be to invite a contention that the film has sought so earnestly to avoid  one must hope that many viewers will have the skill to view che without politics and the bias that inevitably engenders  whatever its faults  it rehabilitates soderbergh

the main event for a wrestlemania  was absolutely unheard of at this time  it only made things that much more tense   br    br   matches   br    br   koko b  ware w frankie vs  the model  rick martel  for a   or so minute match  this is as good as it gets  i wish it was a tad longer  but what i got  was pretty damn good  martel wins  with the boston crab  br    br            br    br   wwf tag team championship  demolition vs colossal connection c  w bobby heean  huge pop for demolition  match itself is pretty dull  i often had trouble paying attention  andre really didn t do much  so in a way it was more like a   on    there is solid talent involved here  and it s a shame they couldn t produce better  demolition wins that titles  with there pattened maneuver off the top  crowd blows the roof of for the finish  br    br            br    br   earthquake w jimmy hart  vs hercules i got what i expected here  a standard boring filler match  with earthquake doing his thing  i m not really a fan of either  so it didn t perk my interest much  quake wins with his sit down splash  br    br       br    br   brutus beefcake vs mr pefect w the genius  deafening pop for bruti  really good match up  with sadly not enough time given to develop even further  it really kept my interest  and remains one of my favorites on the card  beefcake wins with a slingshot to the post  much to the crowd s approval  br    br       br    br   roddy piper vs bad news brown  huge pop for piper  nothing more than a boring brawl  that does not know what it wants to be  some entertaining antics from the hot rod  but nothing else  noteworthy for roddy painting himself half black  and calling himself  hot scott  br    br       br    br   the hart foundation vs the bolsheviks  record breaking  but other than that  nothing to see here  harts win with  the hart attack  br    br       br    br   the barbarian w bobby heenan  vs tito santana  average for the time it got  but watchable nonetheless  crowd was rather dead for it  except for heenan s interference  jessie s hilarious cracks  about tito s food is more entertaining  then the match itself  barbarian wins with a nasty looking  flying clothesline off the top  br    br       br    br   mixed tag match  dusty sapphire w elizabeth  vs macho king sherri  big pop for dusty  and an even bigger one for elizabeth  who looks absolutely stunning  might i add  i thought it was ok  it was lively at least  if nothing that great  i m not a fan of dusty  so  dusty and sapphire win  when she rolls up sherri  br    br       br    br   the orient express w fuji  vs the rockers  crowd is rather anemic for this  surprisingly  decent no doubt  but with these guys involved  it should have been better  the constant focus with fuji  kinda detracts from the match  express wins by count out  when janetty gets nailed with salt  br    br            br    br   jim duggan vs dino bravo w earthquake jimmy hart  duggan like an idiot  brings out the american flag in canada  duggan gets some solid boo s for it too  but that also may be due to bravo s canadian heritage  crappy match all around  i don t care for duggan  but that s not why it sucked  too short in the end  to really matter  duggan wins when he whacks bravo in the back  with the two by four  duggan gets splashed for his troubles  br    br       br    br   million dollar championship  ted dibiase c  w virgil  vs jake robers w damien  some slow spots  but when all was said and done  i had a good time  two solid wrestlers giving it there all  resulted in an entertaining match up  crowd noticeably gets ancy during parts of it though  by doing the wave  dibiase wins by count out  jake has the last laugh  by giving away some of his money  much to the crowd s delight  br    br       br    br   big bossman vs akeem w slick  nice pop for the bossman  too routine  and too short to really mean anything  in the end  akeem was a gimmick  i was never too fond of  bossman wins with his slam  br    br       br    br   the rhythm blues segment was pretty much a failure  crowd wasn t into it br    br   rick rude w bobby heenan  vs jimmy snuka  for a filler match  before the main event  this wasn t too bad  if it had time to get going more  it would have been excellent  for sure  rude wins  with the rude awakening  br    br       br    br   title for title  ultimate warrior ic champ  vs hulk hogan wwf champ  this one is all about the atmosphere from the crowd  and the split crowd reaction  for the most part  warrior got a pretty decent pop  but in my opinion it was a little underwhelming  hogan dwarfs it completely with his  it s one of wrestlemania s best matches in history  with two people  who aren t really known for there wrestling  they managed to create an amazing match up that was talked about for ages  i have seen this many times  and my respect level grows higher for each one  for their effort  considering i m not a fan of either  even die hard fanatics who crave pure wrestling  can t bitch about this one   warrior wins with his splash   br    br       br    br   bottom line  wrestlemania   is an entertaining entry  if nothing overly special  it s memorable for the main event  the location  and the crowd  but it s not one of the best if you ask me  that being said i do enjoy it  and i give it my recommendation to fellow wrestling fans  br    br       ',\n",

       " 'i picked up time changer because it looked like a nice low budget scifi time travel movie and i was in the mood for something like that  the description said it had something to do with some biblical stuff and time travel but i didn t expect a fundamentalist christian film  br    br   the movie had decent special effects and an interesting premise that could have gone places and been far more interesting than it ended up being  our hero  who is a bible professor from the     s  eventually travels forward to the     s and finds that modern life is filled with the influences of evil   jesus is nowhere to be found  this wonderful technological feat is accomplished with the assistance of a fellow bible teacher who somehow managed to invent a functional hg wells style time machine  the movie starts to lose some credibility at this point  which is unfortunate because this happens very early in the film  earlier  or perhaps immediately later  can t remember for certain   our hero professor was seen teaching what appeared to be a science class where he claimed that scientific findings could only be considered validated if it could be matched with what the bible says  what should be obvious to anyone is that this is clearly not what the scientific method is about  however it is presented such that the filmmakers appear to prefer the point of view that science is useful only if it supports their claims and otherwise is not useful  br    br   in any case  that belief is perfectly valid and sensible in the context of the character at the time  so  if we accept that as the fact of life for these bible professors  then obviously the professor who went and invented the time machine isn t a very strong believer as i don t think there s any evidence  and none was offered  for the physics of time travel in the bible  so immediately there s a problem with mixed messages and credibility there  but never mind    br    br   after the professor is convinced to take the leap into the future  the shock of modern technology was handled quite well in most cases  it was also fun to not have it pinned down to an exact year  as the character is reading the date off a newspaper to himself  a car honks a horn and it scares him into not finishing the date  it s just two thousand and     honk    some of the shock went on a little too long  though  for instance  the car was one of the first things he encountered when he arrived and around two days later he s invited to a church movie night and takes a ride in a van  he sticks his head out the window like a dog might  is scared by the headlights and the starting engine  etc  that seemed a bit off since he d been there a few days by this point and the city appeared to be quite busy with traffic  in any case  that s easy to ignore  the rest of the tech shock was well done   especially his first encounter with the tv which was delayed because he didn t even realize what it was until he saw a kid watching one and using a remote  br    br   unfortunately  our hero predictably starts to preach to virtually everyone he meets as if he s an authority on all life and religion just because he s from the past and is an elder  eventually he gets himself a brief moment in the spotlight at the church he had been visiting where he proceeds to explain his concept of christianity to them in a long monologue that was supposed to be moving and insightful  but mostly was just more of the same  a couple of husbands in the church begin to get a funny feeling about this guy  go figure  and investigate his name  they eventually conclude that he either is a time traveler or is impersonating this long dead bible professor and decide to find out which it is  the movie frames these guys as non believer bad guys for being skeptical  br    br   just before the professor is to head back to his own time  he is confronted by those two men  in an effort to avoid being arrested or hauled away  he eventually breaks into an almost insane like rant about how jesus is coming soon and that he s a prophet so they should listen to him  just in time  he s whisked away and one of the husbands wonders if perhaps this is the rapture he d heard so much about  br    br   the irony is that this essentially means the professor became a self proclaimed  and most likely false  prophet claiming to know that the rapture was near and he was sent by god when truthfully he was sent by his fellow bible professor and did not have any god given knowledge  that was stated or even hinted at   br    br   as i understand it  revelation claims that the time of the end is only for god to know and at the end of the film we see the inventor professor trying  and failing  to send a bible into the future  first       then       etc  as the scene fades out  clearly he s trying to determine the exact date of the end times   which he shouldn t be able to know  essentially  the entire premise of the movie cancels itself out because by being so insistent on their religious beliefs and how certain things are for god to know only  it means there couldn t ever be a time machine in the first place because then mankind could find out something that only god should know  the entire movie s premise collapses and makes the whole thing basically worthless as it undermines it s own credibility in the end ',\n",

       " 'the war between the states was perhaps the darkest hour in the history of america  a war that pitted brother against brother and family against family and left scars that even today have not yet healed  and in all probability never will  and  as in any story about any war  beyond any historical significance it is the personal discord behind the greater conflict that creates the emotional impetus that makes it involving  it is the human element that renders the context necessary to give it perspective  which is what director ang lee provides in  ride with the devil   a civil war drama in which he focuses on the personal travails within the broader depiction of the war itself  and along the way manages to include an examination of one of the bloodiest chapters of the war  the infamous raid on lawrence  kansas  by quantrill and his raiders  which he succeeds in presenting quite objectively from the confederate point of view  br    br   in       the union influence predominates in the state of kansas  and even across the border in neighboring missouri  those with confederate loyalties are finding it increasingly difficult to hold out against the encroaching northerners  especially without the aid of what could be considered any  regular  confederate troops  and when things begin to really heat up around their own town  jack bull chiles  skeet ulrich  and jake roedel  tobey maguire  form a band of their own and join in the fray  doing damage to the union cause wherever it is practicable  jack bull and jake do not like the war and do not like killing  but they are standing up for what they believe to be right   br    br   there are others  however  even among their own  men like the young pitt mackeson  jonathan rhys meyers   who will use the conflict as a vehicle for personal gain and as nothing more than an excuse to express their own violent nature through unnecessary brutality  perpetrated in many instances against innocent victims  and so  for jack bull and jake  as well as many just like them  it becomes a time in which loyalty and moral judgments will be sorely tested  a time during which their souls will be tempered in blood  and they will have to ride with the very devil himself  against seemingly insurmountable odds  br    br   as with all of his films  director ang lee approaches his story through an incisive  yet subtle examination of the traditions  cultural aspects and moral attitudes of the people and times he is depicting  and in so doing  lee provides his audience with at least some understanding of his subject that goes beyond the actual story and ultimately offers  perhaps  a deeper grasp of the motivations that propel his characters and the drama in which they are engaged  whether it s the traditions and customs that account for the relationship between a father and his daughters   eat drink man woman    the effects of class distinction   sense and sensibility    the honor and code by which a warrior lives and dies   crouching tiger  hidden dragon   or the moral ambiguities fostered by a lack of all of the above   the ice storm    lee infuses his films with insights into the human condition that take them to a higher level  this film is no exception  and  as he does with all his films   lee presents his story with the aid of breathtaking cinematography  in this film  by frederick elmes  who also did  the ice storm  brilliantly   which under his guidance is nothing less than visual poetry  it s that special lee touch  and it adds a wistful  reflective sense to whatever story he is telling  which is one of the elements that make his films so memorable  br    br   as jake  tobey maguire initially brings a sense of youthful innocence to the film that contrasts so effectively with the maturity he conveys later on as the story develops  and his character along with it  most importantly  maguire convincingly and believably responds to the events that unfold around him  which adds to the credibility of the overall film and underscores the realism of the presentation  his stoic acceptance of death and the news of those  murdered  in the various skirmishes and battles  the moral propriety to which those he encounters adhere  even in such troubled times  the betrayal  which because of the nature of the conflict is almost commonplace  and the loyalty and beliefs to which he and his companions cling adamantly  it is all of this that maguire achieves through his performance  and it is no small accomplishment  it is  however  the kind of studied  understated performance that is often taken for granted  which is unfortunate  work like this is worthy of acclaim  and should be recognized  br    br   skeet ulrich is effective  as well  as jack bull  and jewel  in her motion picture debut  turns in an engaging performance as sue lee shelley  it is jeffrey wright  however  who stands out in a notable supporting role as daniel holt  as well as jonathan rhys meyers  who brings a chilling christopher walken like menace to his role of pitt  also  in what amounts to a cameo role  one scene   mark ruffalo leaves an indelible impression with very little screen time  br    br   the supporting cast includes james caviezel  black john   simon baker  george clyde   tom guiry  riley   tom wilkinson  orton brown   john ales  quantrill   john judd  otto roedel  and kathleen warfel  mrs  chiles   the civil war will forever be an open wound upon the nation  but hopefully  as time goes on  it will be through the objective contemplations of filmmakers like ang lee and films like  ride with the devil  that will ultimately help to close the schism and promote healing  in light of more recent events  it is something that is sorely needed  worldwide  film is a powerful medium  it can be educational as well as entertaining  and perhaps in the future more filmmakers  like ang lee  will embrace and promote a sense of unity through the sensitive depiction of the events and attitudes that make us what we are         br    br     br    br     br    br   ',\n",

each individual effort either delivers or it doesn t  so  here are ten elements that make a bond film a bond film  and even though never say never again is not technically part of the official bond filmography  the mere presence of sean connery returning as     makes it something more than merely an honorary member of the series  anyway  here s how it rates on a scale of   to      br    br   title  never say never again  the clever title has no apparent link to the actual storyline  but is instead an in joke reference to sean connery s vow to never play oo  again after having been lured back once before for diamonds are forever  whatever the case  it is a catchy title    points  br    br   pre credit teaser  perhaps trying to avoid any obvious parallels to the official eon series of bond films  there is no teaser  the opening scenes are just shown behind the credits  and even that is disappointing  yet another  oh no  bond has been killed  fakeout    points  br    br   opening credits  other than a screen full of tiny     s  they didn t even bother trying to jazz up the credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles    points  br    br   theme song  as written by michel legrand and sung by lani hall  never say never again  would make for a perfectly pleasant part of a particularly long elevator ride  as a bond theme  it s merely okay    points  br    br    bond  james bond   appropriately  since this film sees connery being lured back into service as bond after a decade s hiatus  the story begins with     facing the question as to whether bond connery is still up to the job  happily  connery more than proves himself ready for bondage again  though he is a bit grayer  sporting a bit more girth and wearing a slightly more obvious toupee  he seems to have no trouble slipping back into action  all in all  it is one of connery s best  and most relaxed  turns as the character    points  br    br   bond babes  even in the best of the bond films  the female characters aren t given much dimension  they exist largely as necessary props for bond s use  future oscar winner kim basinger is granted a great deal of leeway in creating her character of domino petachi and the film benefits from this  she does a nice job    and she s not bad to look at either    points  br    br   bond villain  the reports of his death being obviously exaggerated  blofeld is back    at least  for the moment    showing he has more lives than his prized pussycat  one time jesus portrayer turned stereotypical villain  max von sydow isn t given a lot to do in the role  but is a silky presence nonetheless  but he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by klaus maria brandauer as maximilian largo  after a string of banal bond villains  it is so refreshing for brandauer to gave a performance that is both subtle  yet colorfully evil  funny without being campy  ruthless without seeming cartoonish  his largo ranks right up there with auric goldfinger as one of bond s best villains     points  br    br   bond baddies  fatima blush  what can i say  as played with all the bold style of a particularly flamboyant drag queen  barbara carrera breezes through the film  displaying a mix of self amused evil and more than a tad of pure psychotic insanity  bond has crossed paths with a variety of femmes fatales  most of whom have been so easily disposed of that they existed more as amusing eye candy than as characters  but few dared to exhibit such a flare for the dramatic or such fierce determination  even her untimely demise is spectacular  even by bondian standards     points  br    br   sinister plot  as a remake of sorts of thunderball  the film does seem a bit been there done that  nuclear missiles are stolen and major real estate will go kaboom if all the countries of the world don t pay a multi kazillion dollar ransom  but at least producer kevin mcclory was lucky enough to find himself forced to remake one of the weakest bond adventures  by comparisons  this effort blows thunderball out of the water  and despite the absence of many bondian trademarks  the film succeeds on its own    points  br    br   production values  the film starts out with an uneasy style  like a tv movie trying to be more than it can  but as the story progress  the film gains momentum and a sense of purpose  making it a superior adventure    points   br    br   bonus points  there are several odd changes that sets this bond film apart from the official series  miss moneypenny is hardly acknowledged  as played by edward fox   m  is a cranky old grouch with no respect for the  double os   a foreshadowing of how judi dench would later play the part  and  q  suddenly has a cockney accent and is all buddy buddy with bond  and there is a curious sense of nostalgia throughout the film  such as replacing bond s astin martin with a vintage packard and a tango dance number that is cleverly inserted into the story  and a big rescue near the end is on horseback  an homage to the raiders of the lost ark  which was itself a tribute to the bond films    points  br    br   summary  never say never again is a mixed bag  in the really important areas  it more than holds it own thanks to hero connery  villain brandauer  assassin carrera and damsel in distress basinger  but the devil is in the details  as seemingly unimportant as the opening credits  theme song and such seem  the film is lacking because of their absence  it all comes off as a faux bond film  a very good substitute  but a substitute nonetheless  br    br
